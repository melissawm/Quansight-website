The 2024 Quansight Labs Internship Program started July 1st, and we’re excited to introduce our eight interns!

The Quansight Labs summer internship was created to provide up-and-coming open source talent with the opportunity to connect with the community, work alongside open source leaders, and grow professionally while developing solutions for the larger scientific open source ecosystem. Each project focuses on a different part of our ecosystem, and gives interns a chance to contribute and interact with different open source communities.

This year, we also have the pleasure of collaborating with Oxford University and welcome two interns from that institution.

Now, let’s meet the 2024 cohort!

## Quansight Labs’ 2024 Summer Interns

[Jules Poon](https://github.com/JuliaPoo) joins us from Singapore, and is the first participant of this year's program, as she started earlier than the official start date. She has already made several contributions to NumPy and is working on algorithms for data approximations with splines for SciPy. She is interested in commutative algebra and origami, and food is a primary motivator for getting out of bed.

[Bruno Kind](https://github.com/condekind) is from Belo Horizonte, Brazil and will be working on making Polars plugins super-extra-accessible. They love computer and board games: Dota 2 and Gaia Project to name favorites. They've done some beginner-level attempts at 3D-printing as a hobby but a stronger hobby stepped in and broke the printer while playing with custom firmware. Bruno's favorite food is noodles, and they appreciate high fantasy scientific fiction.

[Chiemezuo Akujobi](https://github.com/chiemezuo) (or Mezuo, for short) joins us from Abuja, Nigeria. He will be working on Bokeh accessibility testing. He is a full stack developer with a strong preference for working on backend. Mezuo is a Google Summer of Code contributor to the Wagtail CMS repository, lifelong learner, and a big fan of superhero-themed movies, comics, and cartoons. Reading and coding to electronic music in a cozy environment are some of his favorite activities, although he lists a host of hobbies that include spending quality time with friends and family, traveling, working out at a gym, listening to music, taking long strolls, and playing football.

[Pranav Goswami](https://github.com/pranavchiku) is in Gujarat (west India) and will be working on extending support for BLAS and LAPACK in web environments by way of stdlib.js. Pranav has been an active OSS contributor in recent years to the LFortran and stdlib.js projects, among others. He is a computer science graduate from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jodhpur. Some of his interests are statistics, compilers, motorsports, cricket, etc. and he loves to talk and discuss things.

[Swayam Singh](https://github.com/swayaminsync), joining us from Southern India (Banglore, Karnataka), will be working on implementing a new extended precision data type for NumPy. This project aims to address the inconsistencies in the current "long double" type across different systems and architectures, potentially supporting both 128-bit and 80-bit precision. He recently graduated in July with a BTech in computer science. His primary field of work is machine learning, and lately, he has been getting more interested in parallel and distributed computing and low-level optimizations. Apart from working, good food is all he needs; he enjoys reading manga and working out.

[Dea Leon](https://github.com/deamarialeon) lives in Paris, France and will be working on Sparse documentation and maintenance tasks. She is an electrical engineer, and has worked in Mexico, the US, and France, and is changing careers to software development. She started contributing to OS at the end of 2022 and has made contributions to pandas, Narwhals, conbench (Voltron) and sklearn among other smaller projects. She also likes dancing, reading, and working out. (In that order!)

[Olly Britton](https://github.com/ollybritton) is a university student at Christ Church, Oxford studying mathematics and computer science. He will be working on multidimensional cubature integration methods in SciPy. Outside of mathematics and computer science, he's a keen runner and is hoping to get some miles in over the British summer as well as some pull requests!

[Anushka Suyal](https://github.com/anushkasuyal) is a first year undergraduate doing computer science at the University of Oxford. She will be working on developing support for sparse tensors in SciPy, which she is really excited about! Outside of her technical interests, she enjoys listening to music, reading, and crocheting.

A warm welcome to all of you! We are excited to see your projects develop over the next three months.
